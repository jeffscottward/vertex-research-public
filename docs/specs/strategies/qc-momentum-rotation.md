# Momentum Rotation, Top 2 by 12-1 Month Return (QuantConnect port)

Status: research only. No live or paper orders. No broker changes. No engine is armed by this file.

## Source

- QuantConnect Strategy Library: [Asset Class Momentum](https://www.quantconnect.com/learning/articles/investment-strategy-library/asset-class-momentum) (references Quantpedia, "Asset Class Momentum - Rotational System"). Read 2026-11-08.
- Rule as stated: five ETFs across asset classes; each month pick the 3 with the strongest 12-month momentum (MomentumPercent, 12 months), equal weight, hold one month, rebalance.
- Port request: top 2 by 12-1 month return, only with positive momentum.
- Port request: owner, 2026-11-08 (QuantConnect idea ports; owner decision 2026-11-08: full strategy DSL with defined-risk option legs and reusable entry gates, TypeScript and Python engines in parity). This port does not reproduce QuantConnect's backtest. It trades the idea as defined-risk option spreads on modeled option prices, because the owner's options-only rule forbids share positions and naked futures.

## Classification

- Type: standalone monthly rotation (cross-sectional momentum with an absolute filter).
- Direction: long, defined risk (call debit verticals only).

Basis codes: S = stated by the source page; O = set by the owner's port request (2026-11-08); A = Vertex default, fixed before the first run.

## Rules

|#|Rule|Basis|
|---|---|---|
|1|Universe: Core 7 ETFs. The source used five asset-class ETFs and the top 3.|O|
|2|Momentum at month-end t: 12-1 return = `adj_close` at month-end t−1 / `adj_close` at month-end t−12 − 1 (the most recent month is skipped).|O|
|3|Selection: rank eligible members by momentum; hold the top 2 that have momentum > 0. Fewer than two positive members: hold those that are positive (possibly none). Ties: higher 12-month return first, then symbol order.|O / A (ties: A)|
|4|Monthly rebalance: the signal is computed at the month-end close; trades execute at the close of the first trading day of the next month. At each rebalance every open spread is closed and the selected spreads are opened fresh (a monthly roll), so a member that stays selected is rolled, not held.|S / A|
|5|Structure: call debit vertical, `longDelta` 0.5, `widthSigma` 1.0, expiry nearest 60 DTE with DTE ≥ 45, `maxLossPct` 2, no profit-take, no `exitDte` (the monthly roll closes it at about 30 to 40 DTE).|A|

## Backtest design (fixed 2026-11-08, before the first run)

- A member is eligible at month-end t when it has `adj_close` at month-end t−12 and its IV index is live. First signals: SPY 1994-01-31 (SPY alone until QQQ joins), QQQ 2001-01-31, DIA 2005-11-30, USO 2007-05-31, GLD 2008-06-30, IWM 2009-09-30, SLV 2011-03-31. One shared-equity portfolio. Sample end 2026-11-06 (last rebalance 2026-11-02).
- The window with all 7 eligible (from 2011-03-31) is reported from the same runs; with one or two members the rule reduces to absolute momentum.
- Baseline B: the same call debit vertical on every eligible member every month (always on, monthly roll), same structure, members and dates. B holds up to 7 spreads where A holds at most 2; each spread risks 2%, and the Sharpe comparison is scale-free.

|Run|Definition|Counted|
|---|---|---|
|A|Top 2 by 12-1 momentum, momentum > 0 (primary)|yes|
|B|Always-on monthly call debit verticals on all eligible members (baseline)|yes|

Runs in this spec: 2. Family total: 32.

Common to all QuantConnect ports:

- Data: `research/backtests/qc-ports/fetch_data.py`, output in `~/Documents/reports/vertex-qc-ports/data` on the rig (fetched 2026-11-08: Yahoo daily bars and indices to 2026-11-06, CBOE history for RVX and VXSLV, Shiller monthly data to 2026-06). Not committed (the Yahoo, CBOE and Shiller terms do not allow redistribution); the study records the SHA-256 values from `SHA256SUMS`.
- Calendar: NYSE trading days from the SPY bars. Month-end = the last SPY trading day of the month. Other series are aligned to these dates with the last value on or before each date.
- Prices: option strikes and spot use `close` (split-adjusted, not dividend-adjusted). Signals that say total return use `adj_close`.
- Option prices: modeled with Black-Scholes, not real chains. ATM implied volatility = 0.9 × the symbol's CBOE index for VIX, VXN, VXD and RVX, 0.95 × for GVZ, OVX and VXSLV, with the per-symbol skew slope in `options.py`. Index per symbol: SPY VIX, QQQ VXN, DIA VXD, IWM RVX, GLD GVZ, SLV VXSLV, USO OVX. r from IRX; constant dividend yield q: SPY 1.5%, QQQ 0.7%, DIA 1.8%, IWM 1.2%, others 0. Strike grid USD 1 when spot ≥ 25, else USD 0.50.
- Expiry: the standard monthly expiry (third Friday, or the prior trading day when that Friday is a holiday) nearest the target DTE among expiries with DTE ≥ the minimum.
- Legs: debit vertical = long leg at `longDelta`, short leg `widthSigma` × ATM IV × √T × spot further out of the money (at least one strike step). Credit vertical = short leg at `shortDelta`, long leg the same distance further out of the money.
- Costs, charged on every opening and closing trade: USD 0.65 per contract per leg plus half the modeled bid-ask spread per leg, max(USD 0.01, pct × leg mid), pct SPY 1%, QQQ 1.5%, IWM 2%, DIA 3%, GLD 2.5%, SLV 4%, USO 4%. A spread held to expiry settles at intrinsic value without costs.
- Sizing: starting capital USD 100,000. Contracts = floor(2% × current equity / maximum loss per contract), also limited by the cash left; maximum loss per contract = the entry value plus entry costs (debit vertical: debit × 100; credit vertical: (width − credit) × 100, fully collateralised). An order risking more than 2% is refused. A signal that sizes to 0 contracts is skipped and counted. A missing IV index or rate on the entry bar means no trade.
- Execution: a signal at the close of bar i trades at the close of bar i+1 at the modeled price after costs. Profit-take, `exitDte` and expiry are checked at each close and executed at that close. Exits are processed before entries each day.
- Marks and cash: open spreads are marked daily at the modeled value (per contract: debit = spread value × 100; credit = (width − spread value) × 100, fully collateralised). Uninvested cash earns no interest.
- Engines: the pure-Python reference ledger (`ledger.py`) and the Nautilus runner (`nautilus_runner.py`) must agree on every trade and on daily equity before a result is recorded.
- Metrics: CAGR, Sharpe ratio (daily equity returns, risk-free rate 0, × √252), deflated Sharpe probability (Bailey and López de Prado, `deflated_sharpe_ratio` in `services/research/backtesting/optimizer.py`), maximum drawdown, worst calendar month, trades, win rate, exposure (share of days with an open spread).
- Multiple testing: the 11 QuantConnect port specs (`docs/specs/strategies/qc-*.md`) pre-register 32 distinct runs; a run shared by several specs counts once. Deflated Sharpe uses n_trials = 32, the variance of the per-day Sharpe ratio across those 32 runs, and the run's own skew, kurtosis and day count. Any added run raises n_trials and is recorded in the study.

## Pass/fail rule (fixed 2026-11-08, before the first run)

The rule passes only if run A, after costs, over its full sample to 2026-11-06, meets ALL of:

1. Sharpe ratio above 0.5.
2. Deflated Sharpe probability above 0.9 with n_trials = 32.
3. Maximum drawdown smaller than 25% (peak to trough of daily equity).
4. Sharpe ratio above run B, the same structure without the signal (always on, monthly), over the same dates.

Return alone is not the bar. Other runs are reported and do not change the verdict. No parameter changes after the first run; a changed rule is a new run and raises n_trials.

## Code and tests

Planned paths; this spec is committed before the code.

- Rules, option model and ledger: `services/research/strategies/qc_ports/` (`data.py`, `calendar.py`, `options.py`, `book.py`, `ledger.py`, `metrics.py`, `nautilus_runner.py`).
- DSL: the `options` block (`callDebitVertical`); ranking runs in the qc_ports runner in `packages/api/src/strategy-dsl.ts`, mirrored in `services/research/nautilus_backtest/signals.py` with golden parity fixtures (TypeScript and Python must agree).
- Tests (hand-computed, written with the engine and before the first run): 12-1 return on hand-built month-ends; ranking ties; fewer than two positive members; members joining mid-sample.
- Data: `research/backtests/qc-ports/fetch_data.py`.
- Results: stored in Postgres `research_studies` (id `qc-momentum-rotation`) with `bun run vertex:research-studies:import`. No results JSON file is committed (AGENTS.md rule 13).

## Results

Not run yet. Results are stored in Postgres `research_studies` (id `qc-momentum-rotation`) and filled in here after the run: run date, data manifest, the metrics of every run in this spec and the verdict.

## Limits

- Option prices are modeled from 30-day CBOE volatility indices with Black-Scholes, not real chains: no real skew surface or term structure, no early exercise or assignment, no pin risk, no liquidity limit. Real fills could be worse, mostly for DIA, SLV and USO spreads.
- Some sample years predate listed options on the ETF (SPY options, for example, listed in January 2005). Results for those years are hypothetical.
- Costs are modeled; no market impact, no tax. Uninvested cash earns nothing, which lowers CAGR for the rule and the baseline alike.
- Yahoo data from one vendor, not checked against a second source.
- Before 2001 the universe is SPY alone and until 2007 at most three members, so the early sample tests absolute momentum on equity ETFs, not rotation across asset classes.
- Maximum drawdown of A and B is not directly comparable in size: B carries more open risk.
